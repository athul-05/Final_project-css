            <p>Adam’s Peak, or Sri Pada, is a revered pilgrimage site and prominent mountain located in central Sri Lanka, standing at 2,243 meters (7,359 feet). Known for the sacred footprint at its summit, believed to be left by Buddha, Adam, Shiva, or Saint Thomas depending on various beliefs, the mountain attracts both religious devotees and hikers.
